## INTRODUCTION
Car glass that is exposed to dirt or rainwater will usually be cleaned using a wiper.
usually, the wiper is attached to the front and rear sides with the wiper,
the driver's view will not be hindered and so they can see clearly towards the front or rear.
Wipers do have a very important role in the safety of the drivers because wiper performance is closely releated to the safety of driving. 
If it is rains a lot and the car does'nt use wipers windshield will be dewy. Visible dew on the glass will block the view of the driver. 
When the driver's view is hindered, the risk of an accident is very high. 
This makes the wipers a very important car enchancement and must be present on all types of vehicles.

## HISTORY
The first windshield appeared in 1904, and consisted of two sheets of window-pane glass. 
These early windshields were prone to shattering upon impact, however, which posed a risk to passengers. 
French artist and chemist Edouard Benedictus gets the credit for inventing the first laminated glass prototype.
